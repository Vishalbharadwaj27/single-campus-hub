About the project 

In this project the admins can create events, modify them and can get the list of students who are participating in each of the events.
whereas the students can read indetail about the events that are lined up and can register or also cancel their registration from a particular event.Also the attendance can be taken for a student for the particular event that the student is participating through the portal itself
This is made for the convenience of the college and its students for easier engagement and involvement of students in all the events whithout the struggle for a manual registeration.

--How i built the project
I have used an ai platform called as LOVABLE ai to do this application, and gave it super specific prompts and made the functional prototype of what was asked to be delivered
